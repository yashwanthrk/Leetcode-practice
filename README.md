# LeetCode Practice Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems, aimed at honing my problem-solving skills and preparing for technical interviews. The solutions are primarily written in Python.

## Repository Structure
- `/problems`: Contains solution files, each named after the problem they solve.
- `.github/workflows`: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for automated tasks, such as testing code submissions.

## Usage
Each solution file can be executed independently to see how the solution works. The repository is integrated with GitHub Actions to ensure all solutions pass the tests upon commits.
