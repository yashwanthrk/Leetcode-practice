            # text
            # Copy code
            # - Initialize a stack with the `source` node.
            # - While the stack is not empty:
            #     - Pop the top node.
            #     - If the node is the destination, return True.
            #     - For each neighbor of the node:
            #         - If itâ€™s not in the seen set:
            #             - Add it to the stack and mark it as visited.
            # - Return False if no path is found.
